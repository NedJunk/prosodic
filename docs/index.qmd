# Prosodic

Prosodic is a metrical-phonological parser written in Python. Currently, it can parse English and Finnish text, but adding additional languages is easy with a pronunciation dictionary or a custom python function. Prosodic was built by [Ryan Heuser](https://github.com/quadrismegistus), [Josh Falk](https://github.com/jsfalk), and [Arto Anttila](http://web.stanford.edu/~anttila/). Josh also maintains [another repository](https://github.com/jsfalk/prosodic1b), in which he has rewritten the part of this project that does phonetic transcription for English and Finnish. [Sam Bowman](https://github.com/sleepinyourhat) has contributed to the codebase as well, adding several new metrical constraints.

"Prosodic 2", in this `develop` branch, is a near-total rewrite of Prosodic.

Supports Python>=3.8.
